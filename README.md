This is the first time using GitHub and creating a Repository.
About Me:
I've worked on conventional data and database for many years,
and understnad the value of information (past and prsent).  
As it was close to impossible to keep, and further process through
the many years of data, the "old" data was archieved or dropped.
I've alway wondered what could be learned from the old archieved data,
and now with introduction of "Big Data" solutions, and inclusion of Data Science
real (and VERY Valuable) information can be had.
